    <description>
      The roots revival of the last few years has primed listeners for a new generation of rustic, heart-on-the-sleeve music. The kind that nods to tradition while setting off into uncharted territory. The Lumineers walk that line with an unerring gift for timeless melodies and soul-stirring lyrics.

        I have a teaching degree to teach music. I always wanted to be a choir teacher. I met the guys shortly after I graduated and I was looking for something to keep me busy before landing a teaching job. I answered a Craigslist ad, which is something I'd never do. I was feeling reckless, I guess.
