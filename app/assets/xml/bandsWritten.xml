      <biography>I have a teaching degree to teach music. I always wanted to be a choir teacher. I met the guys shortly after I graduated and I was looking for something to keep me busy before landing a teaching job. I answered a Craigslist ad, which is something I'd never do. I was feeling reckless, I guess.      </biography>
