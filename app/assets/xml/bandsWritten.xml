      <biography>        I have a teaching degree to teach music. I always wanted to be a choir teacher. I met the guys shortly after I graduated and I was looking for something to keep me busy before landing a teaching job. I answered a Craigslist ad, which is something I'd never do. I was feeling reckless, I guess.      </biography>

      <biography>        Back then, growing up in the New York City suburb of Ramsey, New Jersey, Wesley spent his days drawing. Today, as bandleader of The Lumineers, Wesley has replaced his pencil with a guitar and his drawings with songs.  He still practices a lot, and it still turns out good      </biography>
